## Developed a Python script to fetch and analyze pull requests from the Kubernetes GitHub repository using the GitHub API. The script retrieves pull request data, identifies the creators of each pull request, and   displays the count of pull requests created by each user. Additionally, integrated a function to retrieve the status of servers from a predefined configuration dictionary.

## Key Contributions:
### Implemented a GET request to the GitHub API to fetch pull request data.
### Parsed JSON response to extract relevant information such as pull request creators.
### Utilized dictionaries for efficient storage and manipulation of data.
###Integrated a function to retrieve server status from a predefined configuration dictionary.
